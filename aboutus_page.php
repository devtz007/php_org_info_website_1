                <p>
                    After the establishment of CID in 1904 AD, its branches were established in every province. The
                    merger of CIB with
                    CID
                    in 1910 made the organization stronger and more important. When Dhaka was established as the capital
                    of
                    Bengali-Assam
                    province in 1905, the provincial branch of the CID was established in a beautiful old building at
                    Waizghat of Dhaka
                    Nawabs (now Bulbul Lalitkala Academy). When the partition of Bengal was abolished in 1912, the
                    provincial branch of
                    the
                    CID continued to conduct departmental activities in the said house. After the establishment of East
                    Pakistan in
                    1947,
                    the headquarters of CID again started functioning in this house. When CID's own building was
                    constructed in Malibagh
                    of
                    Dhaka city, the office of CID was shifted from a rented house at Wiseghat in 1961. To make the CID
                    more active and
                    strong, the then Government of Pakistan established a Detective Training School in 1963 at
                    Rajarbagh, not far from
                    the
                    CID headquarters. Under the supervision of an Additional DIG of CID, various categories of Police
                    officers undergo
                    special training in investigations and inquiries. At present, itâ€™s headed by an Additional DIG as
                    Commandant.
                    A Police officer trained in a criminal matter from abroad will be able to perform proper duties in
                    keeping with the
                    modern world. In this way, the trained Police officers of our country will be able to deal with the
                    crime related
                    situations of the modern world. In this way the trained Police officers of our country can be
                    inspired in new
                    research
                    about criminology. It is believed that the modern equipment used in developed countries in the
                    mechanical era will
                    bring
                    more benefits if it is provided to the intelligence department of this country.

                    <strong>Evolution :</strong>From 1963 onward, DTS imparted training as a sole training institute at present. There are two other
                    specialized
                    training centers. These are <strong>Forensic Training Center (FTC)</strong> and <strong>Cyber
                        Training Center (CTC)</strong> respectively. DTS
                    emphasis on
                    Legal issues, FTC emphasis on Forensic and Technical matters and CTC emphasis on Cyber issues.
                    Forensic Training Centre was inaugurated in 16 January 2012 and Cyber Training Centre was
                    inaugurated in 23 January
                    2017.
